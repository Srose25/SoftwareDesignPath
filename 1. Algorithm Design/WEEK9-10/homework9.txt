1. 10 days      10/15/1999 - 10/25/1999
    25 - 15 = 10 days

2. 39 days      10/23/1999 - 12/1/1999
    Oct = 31 - 23 = 8
    Nov = 30
    Dec = 1
    8 + 30 + 1 = 39 days

3. 1596 days    10/21/1999 - 3/4/2004
    year2000 - year2004 = 365 * 3 + 366 = 1461      #2000 is a leap year
    1999
        Octdays = 31 - 21 = 10
        Novdays = 30
        Decdays = 31
    2004
        Jan = 31
        Feb = 29
        Mar = 4
    1460 + 10 + 30 + 31 + 31 + 29 + 4


#Explaination
For this problem we should very first figure out which years are leap years.
This will help us later on with more difficult problems. After we figure out
years are leap years we will need to figure out how many days are in each month.
Either that or find a way for us to easily calculate what day of the year it is
by having the computer look at the month and day. That way we won't need to have 
the program remember variables for several months. After we find out what day we
can start and stop on then we begin our calculations finding out how many days are
in the different dates. Once that's finished we print the final output.
