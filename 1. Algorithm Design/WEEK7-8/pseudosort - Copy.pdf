So the first thing that we're going to need to be doing is having our program 
read through a list of 8 numbers and then pick the smallest number it sees,
then compare and contrast it with each number it sees going down the list.
Once it gets to the end it will swap the smallest number to the beginning of the
list.


#My Pseudocode
FOR beginningnumber in range
    if currentnumber < beginningnumber
        SWAP currentnumber <- beginningnumber
    ELSE
        beginningnumber ->


#AI Pseudocode
function selectionSort(list):
    for i from 0 to length of list - 1:
        minIndex = i

        for j from i+1 to length of list - 1:
            if list[j] < list[minIndex]:
                minIndex = j

        if minIndex â‰  i:
            swap list[i] and list[minIndex]


#My analysis
I didn't think to add the second for loop here as well. I also decided to make this a lot more
readable than both my earlier code and the ai's code. The ai had much better logic since it 
accounted for the second loop. It however didn't have good naming conventions and was hard to
understand. I had to drastically change my pseudocode by the end.


#My Updated Pseudocode
#A
FOR currentNumber in numberList - 1:
    smallestNumber = currentNumber  #This by default sets the smallest number to the number we start on.

    #B
    FOR check from currentNumber + 1 to length of numberList - 1: #Check our number to the end of the list.
        
        
        IF numberList[check] < numberList[smallestNumber]:        #Check if our current number is smaller than
            
            
            smallestNumber = check                                #the one we started on.

    #C
    IF smallestNumber != currentNumber: #If the number we checked is smaller than our original number the swap them.
        SWAP numberList[currentNumber] and numberList[smallestNumber]



numberList = [26, 6, 90, 55]

Step   | currentNumber | check | smallestNumber | Output List

#Final Sorted List: [6, 26, 55, 90]

The program loops through about 10 times in total for about 4 data points
so the algorithmic efficiency is about O(n**2)
