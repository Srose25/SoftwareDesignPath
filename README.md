# SoftwareDesignPath
Homework / Projects for all of my classes during my time here as a student, working on my software engineering degree.


1. Algorithm Design: I initially wanted to take the Software Design path, but decided to go a different direction afterwards. I did write some efficient algorithms though. It entirely consists of Python coding.

2. Programming with Classes: My introduction to OOP. I didn't write the most efficient code but I had a lot of fun with the concept and even made my own little game by the end of it. It entirely consists of C# coding.

3. Web Design: This consists of two classes I took. The first of which taught me the fundamentals of HTML and CSS and the other Javascript.
