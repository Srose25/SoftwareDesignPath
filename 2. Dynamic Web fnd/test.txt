ok I'm going to try and just type on this yellow switch keyboard. It's a little weird but I think I'm starting to get the hang of it.
 It is very thocky. Any input is registered which is crazy. I wish there was just a little bit of give to be honest. I do think though,
that if I keep practicing It won't be so bad.
